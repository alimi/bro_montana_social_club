Hi <%= @questionaire.member_name %>,

Did you get that last email I sent you? The one about the <%= @questionaire.calendar_year %> Questionaire?

In case you didn't get it, the <%= @questionaire.calendar_year %> Questionaire is now available. Go to <%= questionaire_url(@questionaire) %> to take it.

If you have any problems, bring it up with the commish. I'm just a robot.
